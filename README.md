# Project-1
Friday 1
This project has been authored by Collins Muiruri.
This project is one that shows basic skills that i have learnt in the past week.
It is a html written program which shows how css and bootstrap have been incorporated to give life to a html by adding
a picture, 
links to various sites, 
writing words skillfully around images by use of floats,
indenting words that are on a page,
and use of bootstrap styles.
It can be viewed by forking and afterwards opened by atom text editor.
The link that can bring you to this live site is https://github.com/CollinsMuiruri/Project-1.git
