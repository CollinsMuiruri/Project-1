I have a job experience of around two two years as i have been going to work as a florist during my school holidays. I decided to take programming because i had had a taste of it in a high school project during one of the science fairs. I am therefore fully anticipated to learn as much as i can here at Moringa school so as i can be the be the best programmer there is.</p>
